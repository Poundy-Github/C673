/*
	ghs_v850_ren_pdo_cmt.cfg
	Configuration file for PDO C-MT parser for Green Hills for Renesas V850 based projects
	
	This file is also a template that can be used for configuration for different
	compilers. It is basically split into three sections: first macro defintions
	then allocator settings, and finally global options. Note that even though
	the syntax of this file is C-like, there are several restrictions. The
	most important global restriction is that no pre-proc statements other then
	#define and #undef are supported (this means no #include, #if, #ifdef, #endif
	etc.) The definitions themselves could appear in any order, but to make it
	easier to navigate the file is split into the three sections as mentioned
	previously.
	
	This file contains the configuration information for the Green Hills
	V850/RH850 compiler
	Key features:
	- Auto enumeration sizes (as long as option --short_enum option set)
	- Byte order set to 'intel' (little endian)
*/

/*
	Pre-proc macros
	In this part of the file define macros like in normal C-files, but without using 
	new-line escape sequence within a multi-character operator/identifier/constant
	and between the macro name and the opening parenthesis for function-like macros
	(these constraints not only result in a simpler parser, they also lead to easier
	to read code)

/*
	Type allocation definitions
	This part of the file the allocator is configured. The alignment, byte order, and
	representation types of C-types can be specified here. All type descriptions have
	to start with the keyword 'type' followed by the parenthesized bitwise or of the
	types for which the description applies. This is followed by the bracketed ({})
	list of settings. The settings names are: 'alignment', 'size', 'byteorder' and
	'reptype'. It is required that for a valid simple type at least one of 'size'
	and 'reptype' needs to be set. (i.e.: it is not needed for struct/union/enum/function
	and arrays) If 'size' is not set, but 'reptype' is, then the size is auto deduced from
	the representation type. Under circumstances if no built-in type describes the
	representation, it can be useful to just set the size of the type without adding a
	representation type.
