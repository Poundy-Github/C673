"""
There is a module called 'movpy' which has lots of useful values.

The movpy module defines the following names.

* filename = the path to the script we are running
* filedir = the directory that script is in
* movpydir = the directory of the movpy executable
* curdir = the cwd from which we have been called
* libdir = the 'lib' directory that modules/packages are contained in
* commandline != '' if '-c' was passed
* go_interactive = True if '-i' was set.
* interactive = True if we are in an interactive session
* interactive_mode is a function to enter interactive mode 

    interactive_mode(localvars=None, globalvars=None, IPOFF=False, argv=None)

* movpyw = True if we are running under movpyw rather than movpy
