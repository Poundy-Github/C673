///        Note: This file is generated by the RteStandardRtaInstrGenerator. Therefore it must not be altered in the sections between the
///              startTag and the related endTag eg. ___GENERATOR_TAG___XXX___SECTION_START___, ___GENERATOR_TAG___XXX___SECTION_END___
///              as these parts are overwritten at next generatorRun. But code can be added manually outside of these sections. This applies also
///              to the generated functions: Before the startTag and after the endTag code can be added manually but not in between these two tags.
