# This is the configurationInput file in which all relevant information must be collected, like outputPath, required files, ...
# This file has to be provided as an argument to the generator. 
#
# The paths can be given either as absolute paths or as relative paths. 
# In case there are relative path are delivered it is important that a referencePath is given at generator call (optional parameter -r).
# All provided relPath have to be then relative to given referencePath, that the absolute path can be determined in the generator. 
# The format of given information is really important, especially the names on the left hand side.
# It has to be always of the following format: 
#
# <name> : <value> 
#
# Just subtitute the <#######> in below lines with real texts/paths.
