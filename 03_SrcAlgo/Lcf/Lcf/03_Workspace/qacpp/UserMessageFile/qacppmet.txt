* This file specifies the metrics and the metric ranges that are used by the
* metric browser.
*
* This file can be edited but must be in the following format where each field 
* is separated by white space:
*
*       Field 1:                Metric name
*       Field 2:                Metric description - must be within quotes
*       Field 3:                Group (1=function metrics, 2=class metrics, 
*                                       3=file metrics)
*       Field 4:                Minimum range value
*       Field 5:                Maximum range value
