# The task and runnable configuration file for the RteStandardRtaInstrGenerator
# Project: S202

#Note: This file is updated automatically at every generator run. 
#      The default setting is ENABLED. But it can be changed in the GUI of the RteStandardRtaInstrGenerator 
#      To run the generator with GUI the generator has to be called with 'True' as an additional argument. 'True'has to be the last argument.



# The dictionary contains one key per task. Every task contains again a dictionary in which the 
# runtimeMeasurement of the task can be enabled/disabled and of every single runtime within the task.
